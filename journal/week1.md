# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Homework Challenges
1. **Run the dockerfile CMD as an external script**  
I executed the Dockerfile in backed-flask in my local machine.
```
Sameers-MacBook-Air:backend-flask sameermeher$ docker build -t backend-flask-service .

2. **Push and tag a image to DockerHub**  
I already have a account in DockerHub. Tagged and Pushed the backed-flask image into DockerHub

```
docker build -t sameerkm/backend-flask-service:1.0 .
docker push sameerkm/backend-flask-service:1.0
```
3. **Use multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build**  
For this challenge, I changed the Dockerfile of 'backend-flask' into a Multi stage build.
```
